The goal of this repo is to demostrate all possible uses of cherrypy:
    https
    authentication
    handling multiple ips/host names/domain names
    url mapping
    handling url params
    handling http methods (post,get,put,delete)
    handling headers, sessions, cookies
    handling json
    gzipping traffic
    websockets
    multipart messages
    logging
    load balancing
    serving static files
    what else have i missed ?

The reason is that although cherrypy is the simplest and best documented python server, it took me a while to figure these out.
So now I am sharing
